                Jean Pierre fakes that he has seen some monsters in Amazon, so they turn the balloons up and travel in the air to get there. Meanwhile Jean tries to get them in a cave so he can steal the magical rock and make everyone obey him, but his plan fails. He accidently throws the rock down, that opens a portal and 3 monsters escape. Two doctors immediately catch the first one, but the two other flee. They manage to catch the second one in Paris, while it was playing with the Eiffel tower.
